#### 1. Learning Process

[![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/9/logo.png)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/9)

To acquire this knowledge as quickly and as well as possible, we need to know how a human being's `Learning Process` works and how to avoid stumbling blocks during the process. In this module we learn the art of how our brain works and how we can use this knowledge to increase our learning efficiency dramatically.

Tier 0FundamentalGeneral12 Sections+103 hours

In addition, we need fundamental knowledge about the world's most widely used operating systems. This includes `Linux` and `Windows` operating systems. Before we attack these systems, we first need to know how they work, so we can then learn how to best exploit them.

#### 2. Linux Fundamentals

[![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/18/logo.png)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/18)

Linux is one of the most stable operating systems today, and ubiquitous in corporate networks. `Linux Fundamentals` is essential so we learn its structure and can take the appropriate steps to achieve our goals.

Tier 0FundamentalGeneral18 Sections+106 hours

#### 3. Windows Fundamentals

[![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/49/logo.png)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/49)

On the other hand, Windows is one of the more user-friendly operating systems that most companies find in their IT infrastructure. It is essential to understand `Windows Fundamentals` to be able to handle the operating system in the best possible way and achieve the desired results.

Tier 0FundamentalGeneral14 Sections+106 hours

All connected systems communicate via different networks, routes, and protocols on the Internet or internal network. To understand how interconnected systems function and communicate, we must work through some theoretical components to understand key functionality and specific terms.

#### 4. Introduction to Networking

[![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/34/logo.png)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/34)

Most of the information world is interconnected, and understanding how hosts communicate and find each other on the Internet and within internal networks is another fundamental building block that we must master. Without deep understanding of `Networking`, we will not be effective in assessing interconnected systems.

Tier 0FundamentalGeneral12 Sections+103 hours

Web applications represent a separate category. We are comfortable using a web browser and browsing websites. But what happens behind the scenes when we interact with a web application? Before attacking web applications, we must focus on how they function and the processes that occur on the backend when using a web application.

#### 5. Introduction to Web Applications

[![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/75/logo.png)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/75)

Computer networking on the Internet is standardized over many layers and protocols. The most used type of applications are `Web Applications`. These are designed so that any user with a browser and internet connection can access the web pages on the Internet.

Tier 0FundamentalGeneral17 Sections+103 hours

#### 6. Web Requests

[![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/35/logo.png)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/35)

The communication takes place through different types of `Web Requests`, which the web application processes with specific functions. We will cover various types of web requests and how web browsers use them in the background. Some web server misconfigurations may even grant us access to the system without having to even exploit a web application directly.

Tier 0FundamentalGeneral8 Sections+104 hours

#### 7. JavaScript Deobfuscation

[![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/41/logo.png)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/41)

Most web applications nowadays are dynamic and include `JavaScript`, which we must also be familiar with to handle the dynamics of the web page correctly. JavaScript is a very popular programming language and is often obfuscated to make it difficult for attackers (and defenders) to understand the exact functionality of the code.

Tier 0FundamentalDefensive11 Sections+104 hours

As we know, large IT networks need to be closely managed and secured. Most companies have a management structure, as managing hundreds or thousands of systems remotely or physically one by one would be unreasonable. For this reason, various technologies exist to facilitate and accelerate remote management of users, systems, and other resources.

#### 8. Introduction to Active Directory

[![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/74/logo.png)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/74)

Nowadays, most companies use a structured way of managing hundreds or thousands of computers and users. `Active Directory` is used to simplify and speed up management for administrators.

## Information Gathering

Information gathering is an essential part of any assessment. Because information, the knowledge gained from it, the conclusions we draw, and the steps we take are based on the information available. This information must be obtained from somewhere, so it is critical to know how to retrieve it and best leverage it based on our assessment goals.

![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/90/0-PT-Process-IG.png)

From this stage, the next part of our path is clear:

**Path**

**Description**

`Vulnerability Assessment`

The next stop on our journey is `Vulnerability Assessment`, where we use the information found to identify potential weaknesses. We can use vulnerability scanners that will scan the target systems for known vulnerabilities and manual analysis where we try to look behind the scenes to discover where the potential vulnerabilities might lie.

The information we gather in advance will influence the results of the `Exploitation` stage. From this, we can see if we have collected enough or dived deep enough. Time, patience, and personal commitment all play a significant role in information gathering. This is when many penetration testers tend to jump straight into exploiting a potential vulnerability. This often fails and can lead, among other things, to a significant loss of time. Before attempting to exploit anything, we should have completed thorough information gathering, keeping detailed notes along the way, focusing on things to hone in on once we get to the exploitation stage. Most assessments are time-based, so we don't want to waste time bouncing around, which could lead to us missing something critical. Organization and patience are vital while being as thorough as possible.

#### 10. Network Enumeration with Nmap

[![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/19/logo.png)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/19)

Suppose we limit our scope to the corporate network infrastructure. In that case, we should know how to perform the `Network Enumeration with Nmap`, identify the potential targets, and bypass security measures like firewalls, intrusion prevention, and intrusion detection systems (IPS/IDS).

Tier IEasyOffensive12 Sections+107 hours

#### 11. Footprinting

[![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/112/logo.png)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/112)

Once we have identified the potential targets, we need to know how the individual services of these hosts can be examined. It is essential to understand what these services are used for, how they can be misconfigured, and how we, as attackers, can exploit them for our purposes. Because every service that communicates via the network leaves its own `Footprint` that we have to discover, knowing these footprints will give us a more accurate picture of what steps we can take next as we head into the exploitation phase.

#### 12. Information Gathering - Web Edition

[![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/144/logo.png)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/144)

In most cases, web servers and web applications contain a great deal of information that can be used against them. Since web is a vast technical area in its own right, it will be treated separately. A web server can run many web applications, and some of these applications may be only intended for the developers and administrators. Therefore, finding these is an essential part of our `Information Gathering - Web Edition`. We also want to discover as many web applications as possible and gather detailed information on their structure and function which will help inform our attacks.

Tier IIEasyOffensive10 Sections+207 hours

Things can become quite complex when we want to find information about a target company on the Internet. After all, sifting through various sources and social media platforms is time-consuming and requires a great deal of attention and patience.

#### 13. OSINT: Corporate Recon

[![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/28/logo.png)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/28)

This type of research is called open-source intelligence (OSINT) and has many subcategories. In summary, this process involves gathering information from all publicly available sources. `OSINT: Corporate Recon`, gives us a clear and structured approach that will allow us to work through many different types of data and information sources. A simple example would be finding a private SSH key that allows us to log into the corporate network as an administrator.

## Vulnerability Assessment

The vulnerability assessment stage is divided into two areas. On the one hand, it is an approach to scan for known vulnerabilities using automated tools. On the other hand, it is analyzing for potential vulnerabilities through the information found. Many companies conduct regular vulnerability assessment audits to check their infrastructure for new known vulnerabilities and compare them with the latest entries in these tools' databases.

An analysis is more about `thinking outside the box`. We try to discover gaps and opportunities to trick the systems and applications to our advantage and gain unintended access or privileges. This requires creativity and a deep technical understanding. We must connect the various information points we obtain and understand its processes.

![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/90/0-PT-Process-VA.png)

From this stage, there are four paths we can take, depending on how far we have come:

**Path**

**Description**

`Exploitation`

The first we can jump into is the `Exploitation` stage. This happens when we do not yet have access to a system or application. Of course, this assumes that we have already identified at least one gap and prepared everything necessary to attempt to exploit it.

`Post-Exploitation`

The second way leads to the `Post-Exploitation` stage, where we escalate privileges on the target system. This assumes that we are already on the target system and can interact with it.

`Lateral Movement`

Our third option is the `Lateral Movement` stage, where we move from the already exploited system through the network and attack other systems. Again, this assumes that we are already on a target system and can interact with it. However, privilege escalation is not strictly necessary because interacting with the system already allows us to move further in the network under certain circumstances. Other times we will need to escalate privileges before moving laterally. Every assessment is different.

`Information Gathering`

The last option is returning to the `Information Gathering` stage when we do not have enough information on hand. Here we can dig deeper to find more information that will give us a more accurate view.

The ability to analyze comes with time and experience. However, it also needs to be trained because proper analysis makes connections between different points and information. Connecting this information about the target network or target system and our experience will often allow us to recognize specific patterns. We can compare this to reading. Once we have read certain words often enough, we will know that word at some point and understand what it means just by looking at the letters.

#### 14. Vulnerability Assessment

[![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/108/logo.png)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/108)

After summarizing the information, we can use automated tools to scan the defined targets to detect known vulnerabilities in the systems. First, however, we need to know the scoring systems and learn how to configure and use these tools efficiently. The `Vulnerability Assessment` performed by these tools can give us a better overview of the potential vulnerabilities and the configuration of the target system. From this, new paths and opportunities can be revealed to us to help us find another way into the system.

Tier 0EasyOffensive17 Sections+102 hours

#### 15. File Transfers

[![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/24/logo.png)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/24)

Before we can efficiently exploit the potential vulnerabilities, we need to be familiar with techniques and methods to transfer the required data to the target systems. This is because manual adjustments are often necessary to circumvent specific restrictions. Knowing the ways and means to perform `File Transfers` is an essential component that we must master and there are many ways to transfer files both to and from Windows and Linux hosts. If we have found a potential gap and do not know how to transfer the corresponding data to the target system, it will lead us to a dead end.

Tier 0MediumOffensive8 Sections+103 hours

#### 16. Shells & Payloads

[![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/115/logo.png)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/115)

We also need to know what files we need to transfer to gain initial or further access to the systems. For this, it is necessary to know what `Shell & Payloads` are. With the help of the transmitted payloads, we get access to the command line of the target system. Many things have to be taken into consideration because these shells and payloads must be adapted to the environment and the targeted system.

Tier IMediumOffensive17 Sections+102 days

#### 17. Using the Metasploit-Framework

[![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/39/logo.png)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/39)

In addition, there is a handy framework called `Metasploit-Framework` that covers many attacks, enumeration, and privilege escalation methods and makes it faster for us to configure and execute. It can help us speed up our processes and get into the target systems in a semi-automated way. However, before we can do this, we need to understand what this tool is capable of and its limitations.

Tier 0EasyOffensive15 Sections+105 hours

---

## Exploitation

Exploitation is the attack performed against a system or application based on the potential vulnerability discovered during our information gathering and enumeration. We use the information from the `Information Gathering` stage, analyze it in the `Vulnerability Assessment` stage, and prepare the potential attacks. Often many companies and systems use the same applications but make different decisions about their configuration. This is because the same application can often be used for various purposes, and each organization will have different objectives.

![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/90/0-PT-Process-EX.png)

From this stage, there are four paths we can take, depending on how far we have come:

**Path**

**Description**

`Information Gathering`

Once we have initial access to the target system, regardless of how high our privileges are at that moment, we need to gather information about the local system. Whether we use this new information for privilege escalation, lateral movement, or data exfiltration does not matter. Therefore, before we can take any further steps, we need to find out what we are dealing with. This inevitably takes us to the vulnerability assessment stage, where we analyze and evaluate the information we find.

`Post-Exploitation`

`Post-exploitation` is mainly about escalating privileges if we have not yet attained the highest possible rights on the target host. As we know, more opportunities are open to us with higher privileges. This path actually includes the stages `Information Gathering`, `Vulnerability Assessment`, `Exploitation`, and `Lateral Movement` but from an internal perspective on the target system. The direct jump to post-exploitation is less frequent, but it does happen. Because through the exploitation stage, we may already have obtained the highest privileges, and from here on, we start again at `Information Gathering`.

`Lateral Movement`

From here, we can also skip directly over to `Lateral Movement`. This can come under different conditions. If we have achieved the highest privileges on a dual-homed system used to connect two networks, we can likely use this host to start enumerating hosts that were not previously available to us.

`Proof-of-Concept`

We can take the last path after gaining the highest privileges by exploiting an internal system. Of course, we do not necessarily have to have taken over all systems. However, if we have gained the Domain Admin privileges in an Active Directory environment, we can likely move freely across the entire network and perform any actions we can imagine. So we can create the `Proof-of-Concept` from our notes to detail and potentially automate the paths and activities and make them available to the technical department.

This stage is so comprehensive that it has been divided into two distinct areas. The first category is general network protocols often used and present in almost every network. The actual exploitation of the potential and existing vulnerabilities is based on the adaptability and knowledge of the different network protocols we will be dealing with. In addition, we need to be able to create an overview of the existing network to understand its individual components' purposes. In most cases, web servers and applications contain a great deal of information that can be used against them. As stated previously, since web is a vast technical area in its own right, it will be treated separately. We are also interested in the remotely exposed services running on the target hosts, as these may have misconfigurations or known public vulnerabilities that we can leverage for initial access. Finally, existing users also play a significant role in the overall network.

#### 18. Password Attacks

[![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/147/logo.png)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/147)

If potential usernames or passwords were found during our information gathering, we may be able to use them specifically to perform `Password Attacks` on the systems and applications and authenticate ourselves. This module covers various methods to obtain credentials both remotely and locally on Windows and Linux systems.

Tier IMediumOffensive18 Sections+108 hours

#### 19. Attacking Common Services

[![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/116/logo.png)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/116)

Due to the variety of attacks that can be carried out, attacks on specific network services and web applications differ. Therefore, these are separated into different modules, as many specific attacks can only be carried out against web applications. However, there are many essential network services that can almost always be found in any corporate network. Therefore, knowing how to `Attack Common Services` is another major concept that needs to be covered in detail.

Tier IIMediumOffensive19 Sections+208 hours

#### 20. Pivoting, Tunneling & Port Forwarding

[![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/158/logo.png)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/158)

When `Pivoting`, the exploited system is used as a node between the external and internal networks or between different internal networks. This is used to communicate with the internal systems to which we can usually not establish a direct connection from the Internet or another host in the internal network. It does not matter whether these are hosted on-premise or in the cloud. Network access and restrictions can be configured to and from specific hosts, even in the cloud. `Tunnels` must also be created to be able to transfer data securely. `Port forwarding` is often used to forward a local port to the port of an exploited system.

Tier IIMediumOffensive18 Sections+202 days

#### 21. Active Directory Enumeration & Attacks

[![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/logo.png)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/143)

As we already know, most corporate networks are managed by administrators using Active Directory. Therefore, it is crucial to become familiar with this technology and how `Active Directory Enumeration & Attacks` can affect it. Its complexity can often lead to various vulnerabilities. Especially when administrators are careless or imprecise, vulnerabilities often arise that can lead to a complete domain takeover.

Tier IIMediumOffensive36 Sections+207 days

#### Web Exploitation

Web exploitation is the second part of the exploitation stage. Many different technologies, improvements, features, and enhancements have been developed in this area over the last few years, and things are constantly evolving. As a result, many different components come into play when dealing with web applications. This includes many kinds of databases that require differing command syntax to interact with. Due to the diversity of web applications available to companies and their prevalence worldwide, we must deal with this area separately and focus intently on it. Web applications present a vast attack surface and are often the main accessible targets during external penetration testing engagements, so strong web enumeration and exploitation skills are paramount.

#### 22. Using Web Proxies

[![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/110/logo.png)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/110)

Web servers and web applications work based on the HTTP/HTTPS protocol. Like other protocols, this protocol has a fixed structure for requests and responses. We will focus on `Using Web Proxies` to analyze and manipulate these requests. The way these requests and their HTTP headers can be manipulated plays a significant role in the results we can get from them. Even the absence of specific HTTP headers or too many allowed HTTP methods can be very dangerous for the webserver or web application quickly and easily.

Tier IIEasyOffensive15 Sections+208 hours

#### 23. Attacking Web Applications with Ffuf

[![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/54/logo.png)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/54)

After learning which attack methods these web applications can be subject to, we can use many of these attack methods and start `Attacking Web Applications with Ffuf`. Since every web server and application works with many different parameters due to its link with the database, these parameters can be discovered manually and automatically. For this purpose, there are procedures and different possibilities that allow us to find these parameters to exploit further possible vulnerabilities.

Tier 0EasyOffensive13 Sections+105 hours

#### 24. Login Brute Forcing

[![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/57/logo.png)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/57)

Authentication mechanisms are a vital target. Using these, we can gain access to different user accounts with the help of specific vulnerabilities. One of the most effective ways of gaining access is through `Login Brute Forcing`. Almost all web applications that offer any kind of user-specific functions work with the help of some sort of authentication mechanisms.

#### 25. SQL Injection Fundamentals

[![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/33/logo.png)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/33)

Whether it manages products or users, most every web application works with at least one database. This database is linked to the web application in some way and may open up another attack category called SQL Injection. With an understanding of `SQL Injection Fundamentals`, we can manipulate or exploit the database for our purposes by abusing functionality contained within the web application.

Tier 0MediumOffensive17 Sections+108 hours

#### 26. SQLMap Essentials

[![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/58/logo.png)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/58)

Many of the attacks against web application database are summarized in a tool called SQLMap and should therefore also be learned to speed up our process after manual inspection. `SQLMap Essentials` should be learned to apply the tool appropriately and adapt it to the web application.

#### 27. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

[![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/103/logo.png)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/103)

`Cross-site Scripting (XSS)` is another of the most common attack categories. These vulnerabilities can be leveraged to launch various attacks, such as phishing, session hijacking, and others. Among other things, we can also potentially take over web sessions from other users or even administrators.

Tier IIEasyOffensive10 Sections+206 hours

#### 28. File Inclusion

[![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/23/logo.png)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/23)

Depending on the webserver configuration and the web application, some vulnerabilities allow us some type of `File Inclusion`. For example, we may be able to acess files on the target system or use our own to execute code without being provided access by the developers or administrators.

Tier 0MediumOffensive11 Sections+108 hours

#### 29. Command Injections

[![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/109/logo.png)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/109)

We do not always need to attack the database using SQL Injections or XSS. Often direct `Command Injections` can be used to execute system commands. Some command injections are easier to spot than others, which may require advanced knowledge of identifying and bypassing filters in place.

[![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/113/logo.png)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/113)

Common web applications might be customized by administrators but are nevertheless used worldwide. Therefore, it is also essential to know how to `Attack Common Applications`.

Tier IIMediumOffensive22 Sections+202 days

## Post-Exploitation

In most cases, when we exploit certain services for our purposes to gain access to the system, we usually do not obtain the highest possible privileges. Because services are typically configured in a certain way "isolated" to stop potential attackers, bypassing these restrictions is the next step we take in this stage. However, it is not always easy to escalate the privileges. After gaining in-depth knowledge about how these operating systems function, we must adapt our techniques to the particular operating system and carefully study how `Linux Privilege Escalation` and `Windows Privilege Escalation` work.

![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/90/0-PT-Process-POEX.png)

From this stage, there are four paths we can take, depending on how far we have come:

**Path**

**Description**

`Information Gathering / Pillaging`

Before we can begin escalating privileges, we must first get an overview of the inner workings of the exploited system. After all, we do not know which users are on the system and what options are available to us up to this point. This step is also known as `Pillaging`. This path is not optional, as with the others, but essential. Again, entering the `Information Gathering` stage puts us in this perspective. This inevitably takes us to the vulnerability assessment stage, where we analyze and evaluate the information we find.

`Exploitation`

Suppose we have found sensitive information about the system and its' contents. In that case, we can use it to exploit local applications or services with higher privileges to execute commands with those privileges.

`Lateral Movement`

From here, we can also skip directly over to `Lateral Movement`. This can come under different conditions. If we have achieved the highest privileges on a dual-homed system used to connect two networks, we can likely use this host to start enumerating hosts that were not previously available to us.

`Proof-of-Concept`

We can take the last path after gaining the highest privileges by exploiting an internal system. Of course, we do not necessarily have to have taken over all systems. However, if we have gained the Domain Admin privileges in an Active Directory environment, we can likely move freely across the entire network and perform any actions we can imagine. So we can create the `Proof-of-Concept` from our notes to detail and potentially automate the paths and activities and make them available to the technical department.

After we have gained access to a system, we must be able to take further steps from within the system. During a penetration test, customers often want to find out how far an attacker could go in their network. There are many different versions of operating systems. For example, we may run into Windows XP, Windows 7, 8, 10, 11, and Windows Server 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2019. There are also different distributions for Linux-based operating systems, such as Ubuntu, Debian, Parrot OS, Arch, Deepin, Redhat, Pop!_OS, and many others. No matter which of these systems we get into, we have to find our way around it and understand the individual weak points that a system can have from within.

#### 32. Linux Privilege Escalation

[![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/51/logo.png)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/51)

The vast majority of web servers that make up the World Wide Web run Linux. In addition, we will find many Linux-based servers hosting critical infrastructure services that individuals & organizations use to be more productive and efficient in their daily work. Because of this widespread use of Linux, we must understand the fundamentals. There are many ways to misconfigure Linux systems. Discovering these flaws and taking advantage of them to escalate privileges is covered in `Linux Privilege Escalation`.

Tier IIEasyOffensive15 Sections+1008 hours

#### 33. Windows Privilege Escalation

[![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/67/logo.png)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/67)

Modern Windows systems, now have stronger security precautions (if an organization is diligent with patching), but administrator errors are possible in any environment. There are many different ways to find the misconfigurations in Windows-based systems, and we need them for `Windows Privilege Escalation`.

Tier IIMediumOffensive30 Sections+1004 days

---

## Lateral Movement

Lateral movement is one of the essential components for moving through a corporate network. We can use it to overlap with other internal hosts and further escalate our privileges within the current subnet or another part of the network. However, just like `Pillaging`, the `Lateral Movement` stage requires access to at least one of the systems in the corporate network. In the Exploitation stage, the privileges gained do not play a critical role in the first instance since we can also move through the network without administrator rights.

![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/90/0-PT-Process-LA.png)

There are three paths we can take from this stage:

**Path**

**Description**

`Vulnerability Assessment`

If the penetration test is not finished yet, we can jump from here to the `Vulnerability Assessment` stage. Here, the information already obtained from pillaging is used and analyzed to assess where the network services or applications using an authentication mechanism that we may be able to exploit are running.

`Information Gathering / Pillaging`

After a successful lateral movement, we can jump into `Pillaging` once again. This is local information gathering on the target system that we accessed.

`Proof-of-Concept`

Once we have made the last possible lateral movement and completed our attack on the corporate network, we can summarize the information and steps we have collected and perhaps even automate certain sections that demonstrate vulnerability to the vulnerabilities we have found.

Since both `Lateral Movement` and `Pillaging` require access to an already exploited system, these techniques and methods are covered in different modules, such as `Getting Started`, `Linux Privilege Escalation`, and `Windows Privilege Escalation`, and many others.

---

## Proof-of-Concept

The `Proof-Of-Concept` (`POC`) is merely proof that a vulnerability found exists. As soon as the administrators receive our report, they will try to confirm the vulnerabilities found by reproducing them. After all, no administrator will change business-critical processes without confirming the existence of a given vulnerability. A large network may have many interoperating systems and dependencies that must be checked after making a change, which can take a considerable amount of time and money. Just because a pentester found a given flaw, it doesn't mean that the organization can easily remediate it by just changing one system, as this could negatively affect the business. Administrators must carefully test fixes to ensure no other system is negatively impacted when a change is introduced. PoCs are sent along with the documentation as part of a high-quality penetration test, allowing administrators to use them to confirm the issues themselves.

From this stage, there is only one path we can take:

**Path**

**Description**

`Post-Engagement`

At this point, we can only go to the post-engagement stage, where we optimize and improve the documentation and send it to the customer after an intensive review.

When we already have all the information we have collected and have used the vulnerability to our advantage, it does not take much effort to automate the individual steps for this.

#### 34. Introduction to Python 3

Python is one of the easiest programming languages to learn, and it is also quite powerful. This makes it easy to automate many steps and, with the help of comments in our code, to understand exactly how the vulnerability is exploited step-by-step. Therefore, `Introduction to Python 3` will be sufficient for most aspects of automation once we understand the structure of this programming language.

## Post-Engagement

The `Post-Engagement` stage also includes cleaning up the systems we exploit so that none of these systems can be exploited using our tools. For example, leaving a bind shell on a web server that does not require authentication and is easy to find will do the opposite of what we are trying to do. In this way, we endanger the network through our carelessness. Therefore, it is essential to remove all content that we have transferred to the systems during our penetration test so that the corporate network is left in the same state as before our penetration test. We also should note down any system changes, successful exploitation attempts, captured credentials, and uploaded files in the appendices of our report so our clients can cross-check this against any alerts they receive to prove that they were a result of our testing actions and not an actual attacker in the network.

In addition, we have to reconcile all our notes with the documentation we have written in the meantime to make sure we have not skipped any steps and can provide a comprehensive, well-formatted and neat report to our clients.

#### 35. Documentation & Reporting

[![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/162/logo.png)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/162)

We need to understand proper `Documentation and Reporting`, how to stay organized and take detailed notes, and how to write effectively and deliver high quality client deliverables. Practice in this area will simplify preparation of our reports and save us considerable time. This module also helps us optimize our notetaking and organization, which we must adapt to our needs to work as efficiently as possible.

#### 36. Attacking Enterprise Networks

[![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/163/logo.png)](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/163)

It is essential to get and keep an overall view of all these stages, their contents, and possible challenges. `Attacking Enterprise Networks` can be a daunting task, and we can get lost in the diversity of our options and overlook some of the essentials. So instead, we need to familiarize ourselves with how to attack such large networks and what vulnerabilities may exist with a large number of systems in a network.

Now that we've covered the general layout of Academy modules regarding the penetration testing process, we'll briefly discuss how exercises and questions are presented in HTB Academy.




`Blackbox` `Minimal`. Only the essential information, such as IP addresses and domains, is provided.

`Greybox` `Extended`. In this case, we are provided with additional information, such as specific URLs, hostnames, subnets, and similar.

`Whitebox` `Maximum`. Here everything is disclosed to us. This gives us an internal view of the entire structure, which allows us to prepare an attack using internal information. We may be given detailed configurations, admin credentials, web application source code, etc.

`Red-Teaming`

May include physical testing and social engineering, among other things. Can be combined with any of the above types.

`Purple-Teaming`

It can be combined with any of the above types. However, it focuses on working closely with the defenders.

 A deterministic process is a process in which each state is causally dependent on and determined by other previous states and events. A stochastic process is one in which one state follows from other states only with a certain probability. Here, only statistical conditions can be assumed. For us, several of the above definitions overlap. We use the definition of the penetration testing process from the social sciences to represent `a course of events connected` with `deterministic processes`. This is because all of our steps are based on the events and results we can discover or provoke. `A penetration testing process is defined by successive steps and events performed by the penetration tester to find a path to the predefined objective.`

#### Pre-Engagement

`Pre-engagement` is educating the client and adjusting the contract. All necessary tests and their components are strictly defined and contractually recorded. In a face-to-face meeting or conference call, many arrangements are made, such as:

-   `Non-Disclosure Agreement`
-   `Goals`
-   `Scope`
-   `Time Estimation`
-   `Rules of Engagement`

#### Information Gathering

`Information gathering` describes how we obtain information about the necessary components in various ways. We search for information about the target company and the software and hardware in use to find potential security gaps that we may be able to leverage for a foothold.

#### Vulnerability Assessment

Once we get to the `Vulnerability Assessment` stage, we analyze the results from our `Information Gathering` stage, looking for known vulnerabilities in the systems, applications, and various versions of each to discover possible attack vectors. Vulnerability assessment is the evaluation of potential vulnerabilities, both manually and through automated means. This is used to determine the threat level and the susceptibility of a company's network infrastructure to cyber-attacks.

#### Exploitation

In the `Exploitation` stage, we use the results to test our attacks against the potential vectors and execute them against the target systems to gain initial access to those systems.

#### Post-Exploitation

At this stage of the penetration test, we already have access to the exploited machine and ensure that we still have access to it even if modifications and changes are made. During this phase, we may try to escalate our privileges to obtain the highest possible rights and hunt for sensitive data such as credentials or other data that the client is concerned with protecting (pillaging). Sometimes we perform post-exploitation to demonstrate to a client the impact of our access. Other times we perform post-exploitation as an input to the lateral movement process described next.

#### Lateral Movement

Lateral movement describes movement within the internal network of our target company to access additional hosts at the same or a higher privilege level. It is often an iterative process combined with post-exploitation activities until we reach our goal. For example, we gain a foothold on a web server, escalate privileges and find a password in the registry. We perform further enumeration and see that this password works to access a database server as a local admin user. From here, we can pillage sensitive data from the database and find other credentials to further our access deeper into the network. In this stage, we will typically use many techniques based on the information found on the exploited host or server.

#### Proof-of-Concept

In this stage, we document, step-by-step, the steps we took to achieve network compromise or some level of access. Our goal is to paint a picture of how we were able to chain together multiple weaknesses to reach our goal so they can see a clear picture of how each vulnerability fits in and help prioritize their remediation efforts. If we don't document our steps well, it's hard for the client to understand what we were able to do and, thus, makes their remediation efforts more difficult. If feasible, we could create one or more scripts to automate the steps we took to assist our client in reproducing our findings. We cover this in-depth in the `Documentation & Reporting` module.

#### Post-Engagement

During post-engagement, detailed documentation is prepared for both administrators and client company management to understand the severity of the vulnerabilities found. At this stage, we also clean up all traces of our actions on all hosts and servers. During this stage, we create the deliverables for our client, hold a report walkthrough meeting, and sometimes deliver an executive presentation to target company executives or their board of directors. Lastly, we will archive our testing data per our contractual obligations and company policy. We will typically retain this data for a set period or until we perform a post-remediation assessment (retest) to test the client's fixes.

## Importance

We must internalize this procedure and use it as a basis for all our technical engagements. Each stage's components allow us to precisely understand which areas we need to improve upon and where most of our difficulties and gaps in knowledge are. For example, we can think of a website as a target we need to study.

**Stage**

**Description**

`1. Pre-Engagement`

The first step is to create all the necessary documents in the pre-engagement phase, discuss the assessment objectives, and clarify any questions.

`2. Information Gathering`

Once the pre-engagement activities are complete, we investigate the company's existing website we have been assigned to assess. We identify the technologies in use and learn how the web application functions.

`3. Vulnerability Assessment`

With this information, we can look for known vulnerabilities and investigate questionable features that may allow for unintended actions.

`4. Exploitation`

Once we have found potential vulnerabilities, we prepare our exploit code, tools, and environment and test the webserver for these potential vulnerabilities.

`5. Post-Exploitation`

Once we have successfully exploited the target, we jump into information gathering and examine the webserver from the inside. If we find sensitive information during this stage, we try to escalate our privileges (depending on the system and configurations).

`6. Lateral Movement`

If other servers and hosts in the internal network are in scope, we then try to move through the network and access other hosts and servers using the information we have gathered.

`7. Proof-of-Concept`

We create a proof-of-concept that proves that these vulnerabilities exist and potentially even automate the individual steps that trigger these vulnerabilities.

`8. Post-Engagement`

Finally, the documentation is completed and presented to our client as a formal report deliverable. Afterward, we may hold a report walkthrough meeting to clarify anything about our testing or results and provide any needed support to personnel tasked with remediating our findings.
