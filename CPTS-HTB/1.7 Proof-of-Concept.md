`Proof of Concept` (`PoC`) or `Proof of Principle` is a project management term. In project management, it serves as proof that a project is feasible in principle. The criteria for this can lie in technical or business factors. Therefore, it is the basis for further work, in our case, the necessary steps to secure the corporate network by confirming the discovered vulnerabilities. In other words, it serves as a decision-making basis for the further course of action. At the same time, it enables risks to be identified and minimized.

A `PoC` can have many different representations. For example, `documentation` of the vulnerabilities found can also constitute a PoC. The more practical version of a PoC is a `script` or `code` that automatically exploits the vulnerabilities found. This demonstrates the flawless exploitation of the vulnerabilities. This variant is straightforward for an administrator or developer because they can see what steps our script takes to exploit the vulnerability.
