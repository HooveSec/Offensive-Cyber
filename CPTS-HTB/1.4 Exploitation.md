During the `Exploitation` stage, we look for ways that these weaknesses can be adapted to our use case to obtain the desired role (i.e., a foothold, escalated privileges, etc.). If we want to get a reverse shell, we need to modify the PoC to execute the code, so the target system connects back to us over (ideally) an encrypted connection to an IP address we specify. Therefore, the preparation of an exploit is mainly part of the `Exploitation` stage.

`Complexity` represents the effort of exploiting a specific vulnerability. This is used to estimate how much time, effort, and research is required to execute the attack on the system successfully. Our experience plays an important role here because if we are to carry out an attack that we have never used before, this will logically require much more research and effort since we must understand the attack and the exploit structure in detail before applying it.

Estimating the `probability of damage` caused by the execution of an exploit plays a critical role, as we must avoid any damage to the target systems. Generally, we do not perform DoS attacks unless our client requires them. Nevertheless, attacking the running services live with exploits that can cause damage to the software or the operating system is something that we must avoid at all times.
