All the steps we take to exploit the vulnerabilities are based on the information we enumerate about our targets. This phase can be considered the cornerstone of any penetration test. We can obtain the necessary information relevant to us in many different ways. However, we can divide them into the following categories:

-   Open-Source Intelligence
-   Infrastructure Enumeration
-   Service Enumeration
-   Host Enumeration
