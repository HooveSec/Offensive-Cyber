**Shell Type**

**Description**

`Reverse shell`

Initiates a connection back to a "listener" on our attack box.

`Bind shell`

"Binds" to a specific port on the target host and waits for a connection from our attack box.

`Web shell`

Runs operating system commands via the web browser, typically not interactive or semi-interactive. It can also be used to run single commands (i.e., leveraging a file upload vulnerability and uploading a `PHP` script to run a single command.

. The current OWASP Top 10 list is:

Number

Category

Description

1.[Broken Access Control](https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/)

Restrictions are not appropriately implemented to prevent users from accessing other users accounts, viewing sensitive data, accessing unauthorized functionality, modifying data, etc.

2.[Cryptographic Failures](https://owasp.org/Top10/A02_2021-Cryptographic_Failures/)

Failures related to cryptography which often leads to sensitive data exposure or system compromise.

3.[Injection](https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/)

User-supplied data is not validated, filtered, or sanitized by the application. Some examples of injections are SQL injection, command injection, LDAP injection, etc.

4.[Insecure Design](https://owasp.org/Top10/A04_2021-Insecure_Design/)

These issues happen when the application is not designed with security in mind.

5.[Security Misconfiguration](https://owasp.org/Top10/A05_2021-Security_Misconfiguration/)

Missing appropriate security hardening across any part of the application stack, insecure default configurations, open cloud storage, verbose error messages which disclose too much information.

6.[Vulnerable and Outdated Components](https://owasp.org/Top10/A06_2021-Vulnerable_and_Outdated_Components/)

Using components (both client-side and server-side) that are vulnerable, unsupported, or out of date.

7.[Identification and Authentication Failures](https://owasp.org/Top10/A07_2021-Identification_and_Authentication_Failures/)

Authentication-related attacks that target user's identity, authentication, and session management.

8.[Software and Data Integrity Failures](https://owasp.org/Top10/A08_2021-Software_and_Data_Integrity_Failures/)

Software and data integrity failures relate to code and infrastructure that does not protect against integrity violations. An example of this is where an application relies upon plugins, libraries, or modules from untrusted sources, repositories, and content delivery networks (CDNs).

9.[Security Logging and Monitoring Failures](https://owasp.org/Top10/A09_2021-Security_Logging_and_Monitoring_Failures/)

This category is to help detect, escalate, and respond to active breaches. Without logging and monitoring, breaches cannot be detected..

10.[Server-Side Request Forgery](https://owasp.org/Top10/A10_2021-Server-Side_Request_Forgery_%28SSRF%29/)

SSRF flaws occur whenever a web application is fetching a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URL. It allows an attacker to coerce the application to send a crafted request to an unexpected destination, even when protected by a firewall, VPN, or another type of network access control list (ACL).

Resources
	Vulnerable Machines/Applications
There are many resources available to practice common web and network vulnerabilities in a safe, controlled setting. The following are some examples of purposefully vulnerable web applications and vulnerable machines that we can set up in a lab environment for extra practice.

OWASP Juice Shop	Is a modern vulnerable web application written in Node.js, Express, and Angular which showcases the entire OWASP Top Ten along with many other real-world application security flaws.
Metasploitable 2	Is a purposefully vulnerable Ubuntu Linux VM that can be used to practice enumeration, automated, and manual exploitation.
Metasploitable 3	Is a template for building a vulnerable Windows VM configured with a wide range of vulnerabilities.
DVWA	This is a vulnerable PHP/MySQL web application showcasing many common web application vulnerabilities with varying degrees of difficulty.
It is worth learning how to set these up in your lab environment to gain extra practice setting up VMs and working with common configurations such as setting up a web server. Aside from these vulnerable machines/applications, we can also set up many machines and applications in a lab environment to practice configuration, enumeration/exploitation, and remediation.

YouTube Channels
There are many YouTube channels out there that showcase penetration testing/hacking techniques. A few worth bookmarking are:

IppSec	Provides an extremely in-depth walkthrough of every retired HTB box packed full of insight from his own experience, as well as videos on various techniques.
VbScrub	Provides HTB videos as well as videos on techniques, primarily focusing on Active Directory exploitation.
STÖK	Provides videos on various infosec related topics, mainly focusing on bug bounties and web application penetration testing.
LiveOverflow	Provides videos on a wide variety of technical infosec topics.

Lab	Scenario
Dante	Beginner-friendly to learn common pentesting techniques and methodologies, common pentesting tools, and common vulnerabilities.
Offshore	Active Directory lab that simulates a real-world corporate network.
Cybernetics	Simulates a fully-upgraded and up-to-date Active Directory network environment, which is hardened against attacks. It is aimed at experienced penetration testers and Red Teamers.
RastaLabs	Red Team simulation environment, featuring a combination of attacking misconfigurations and simulated users.
APTLabs	This lab simulates a targeted attack by an external threat agent against an MSP (Managed Service Provider) and is the most advanced Pro Lab offered at this time.
